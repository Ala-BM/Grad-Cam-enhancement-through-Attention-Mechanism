# Grad-Cam-enhancement-through-Attention-Mechanism
This project explores an idea that couldn't be fully researched due to financial limitations. The goal is to enhance model interpretability by integrating Grad-CAM with an attention mechanism, referred to as "GradCamAttention". The core concept is to use Grad-CAM heatmaps to identify important regions of an image, and then retrain the model to focus on those regions. By guiding the model's attention toward areas that influence its predictions, the approach aims to improve both classification performance and the interpretability of the model's decision-making process.
